\section{Transforming natural language text to logical form}

In transforming natural language text to logical form, we build on the software
package Boxer \citep{bos:coling2004}. Boxer
is an extension to the C\&C parser \citep{clark:acl04} that transforms a parsed
discourse of one or more sentences into a semantic representation.  Boxer
outputs the meaning of each discourse as a Discourse Representation Structure
(DRS) that closely resembles the structures described by \citet{kamp:book93}.

We chose to use Boxer for two main reasons.  First, Boxer is a
wide-coverage system that can deal with arbitrary text. 
%  that is able to return a reasonable logical representation
% of most English sentences.  Since our goal is to work with actual texts,
% it is critical that we have a wide-coverage semantic parser.  If
% we did not, then we would be unable to deal with any but the simplest texts. 
Second, the DRSs that Boxer produces are close to the standard first-order
logical forms that are required for use by the MLN software package 
Alchemy.  Our system transforms Boxer output into a format that Alchemy can read and 
augments it with additional information.
