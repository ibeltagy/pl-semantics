Harry Blackmun ## SubjFoundObjFound

Harry Andrew Blackmun ( November 12 , 1908 Â   â € “ March 4 , 1999 ) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1970 until 1994 . Appointed by Republican President Richard Nixon , Blackmun ultimately became one of the most liberal justices on the Court . He is best known as the author of the Court 's opinion in " Roe v. Wade " . Harry Blackmun was born in Nashville , Illinois , the son of Theo Huegely ( Reuter ) and Corwin Manning Blackmun . He grew up in Dayton 's Bluff , a working-class neighborhood in Saint Paul , Minnesota . He attended the same grade school as future Chief Justice Warren E. Burger , with whom he eventually served on the Supreme Court for some sixteen years . He attended Harvard College on scholarship , earning an A.B . " summa cum laude " in mathematics and graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1929 . While at Harvard , Blackmun joined Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity and sang with the Harvard Glee Club ( with whom he performed for President Herbert Hoover in 1929 , Blackmun 's first visit to Washington ) . He attended Harvard Law School ( among his professors there was future Justice of the Supreme Court Felix Frankfurter ) , graduating in 1932 . He served in a variety of positions including private counsel , law clerk , and adjunct faculty at the University of Minnesota Law School and William Mitchell College of Law ( then the St. Paul College of Law ) . Blackmun 's practice as an attorney at the law firm now known as Dorsey & Whitney focused in its early years on taxation , trusts and estates , and civil litigation . He married Dorothy Clark in 1941 and had three daughters with her , Nancy , Sally , and Susan . Between 1950 and 1959 , Blackmun served as resident counsel for the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota . He would later describe his time at Mayo as " his happiest time " ( while describing his later work on the judiciary as where he " performed his duty " ) . In the late 1950s , Blackmun 's close friend Warren E. Burger , then an appellate judge on the D.C . Circuit , repeatedly encouraged Blackmun to seek a judgeship . Judge John B. Sanborn , Jr. of the Eighth Circuit , whom Blackmun had clerked for after graduating from Harvard , told Blackmun of his plans to assume senior status . He said that he would suggest Blackmun 's name to the Eisenhower administration if Blackmun wished to succeed him . After much urging by Sanborn and Burger , Blackmun agreed to accept the nomination , duly offered by Eisenhower and members of the Justice Department . The American Bar Association gave him an extremely high rating of " exceptionally well qualified , " and he was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on September 15 , 1959 . Over the next decade , Blackmun would author 217 opinions for the Eighth Circuit . Blackmun was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Richard M. Nixon on April 14 , 1970 , and was confirmed by the Senate on May 12 , 1970 , by a 94 â € “ 0 vote . He received his commission on May 14 , 1970 . Blackmun was Nixon 's fourth choice . His confirmation followed contentious battles over two previous , failed nominations forwarded by Nixon in 1969 â € “ 1970 , those of Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell . Nixon 's original choice , Lewis F. Powell , Jr. , turned him down but later joined the Court in 1972 . Blackmun , a lifelong Republican , was expected to adhere to a conservative interpretation of the Constitution . The Court 's Chief Justice at the time , Warren Burger , a long-time friend of Blackmun 's and best man at his wedding , had recommended Blackmun for the job to Nixon . The two were often referred to as the " Minnesota Twins " ( a reference to the baseball team , the Minnesota Twins ) because of their common history in Minnesota and because they so often voted together . Indeed , Blackmun voted with Burger in 87.5 percent of the closely divided cases during his first five terms ( 1970 to 1975 ) , and with William J. Brennan , the Court 's leading liberal , in only 13 percent . In 1972 Blackmun joined Burger and the other two Nixon appointees to the Court in dissenting from the " Furman v. Georgia " decision that invalidated all capital punishment laws then in force in the United States , and in 1976 he voted to reinstate the death penalty in " Gregg v. Georgia " , even the mandatory death penalty statutes , although in both instances he indicated his personal opinion of its shortcomings as a policy . Blackmun , however , insisted his political opinions should have no bearing on the death penalty 's constitutionality . That began to change , however , between 1975 and 1980 , by which time Blackmun was joining Brennan in 54.5 percent of the divided cases , and Burger in 45.5 percent . Shortly after Blackmun dissented in " Rizzo v. Goode " ( 1976 ) , William Kunstler embraced him and " welcom [ ed ] him to the company of the 'liberals and the enlightened . ' " During the final five years that Blackmun and Burger served together , Blackmun joined Brennan in 70.6 percent of the close cases , and Burger in only 32.4 percent . In 1973 , Blackmun authored the Court 's opinion in " Roe v. Wade " , invalidating a Texas statute making it a felony to administer an abortion in most circumstances . The Court 's judgment in the companion case of " Doe v. Bolton " held a less restrictive Georgia law to be unconstitutional also . Both decisions were based on the right to privacy announced in " Griswold v. Connecticut " ( 1965 ) and remain the primary basis for the constitutional right to abortion in the United States . " Roe " caused an immediate uproar , and Blackmun 's opinion made him a target for criticism by opponents of abortion , receiving voluminous negative mail and death threats over the case . Blackmun became a passionate advocate for abortion rights , often delivering speeches and lectures promoting " Roe v. Wade " as essential to women 's equality and criticizing " Roe " 's critics . Defending abortion , in " Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists " Blackmun wrote : Blackmun filed separate opinions in 1989 's " Webster v. Reproductive Health Services " and 1992 's " Planned Parenthood v. Casey " , warning that " Roe " was in jeopardy : " I am 83 years old . I can not remain on this Court forever , and when I do step down , the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today . That , I regret , may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made . " Ancillary to the primary right to abortion , Blackmun extended First Amendment protection to commercial speech in " Bigelow v. Commonwealth of Virginia " , a case where the Supreme Court overturned the conviction of an editor who ran an advertisement for an abortion referral service . After " Roe " , Blackmun began to drift away from the influence of Chief Justice Warren Burger to increasingly side with liberal Justice Brennan in finding constitutional protection for unenumerated individual rights . For example , Blackmun wrote a blistering dissent to the Court 's opinion in 1986 's " Bowers v. Hardwick " , denying constitutional protection to homosexual sodomy ( Burger 's opinion in " Bowers " read : " To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching . " To which Blackmun responded by quoting Oliver Wendel Holmes : " it is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV . It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since , and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past . " ) Burger and Blackmun drifted apart , and as the years passed , their lifelong friendship degenerated into a hostile and contentious relationship . From the 1981 term through the 1985 term , Blackmun voted with Brennan 77.6 % of the time , and with Thurgood Marshall 76.1 % . From 1986 to 1990 , his rate of agreement with the two most liberal justices was 97.1 % and 95.8 % . Blackmun 's judicial philosophy increasingly seemed guided by " Roe " , even in areas where " Roe " was not directly applicable . His concurring opinion in 1981 's " Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County " , a case that upheld statutory rape laws that applied only to men but did not implicate " Roe " or abortion , nonetheless included extensive citation of the Court 's recent abortion cases . Despite his stated personal " abhorrence " for the death penalty in " Furman v. Georgia " , he voted to uphold mandatory death penalty statutes at issue in 1976 's " Roberts v. Louisiana " and " Woodson v. North Carolina " , even though these laws would have automatically imposed the death penalty on anyone found guilty of first-degree murder . But on February 22 , 1994 , less than two months before announcing his retirement , Blackmun announced that he now saw the death penalty as always and in all circumstances unconstitutional by issuing a dissent from the Court 's refusal to hear a routine death penalty case ( " Callins v. Collins " ) , declaring that " [ f ] rom this day forward , I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death . " Subsequently , adopting the practice begun by Justices Brennan and Marshall , he issued a dissent from denial of certiorari in every death penalty case , citing and reiterating his " Callins " dissent . As Linda Greenhouse and others have reported , Blackmun 's law clerks prepared what would become the " Callins " dissent well in advance of the case coming before the Court ; Blackmun 's papers indicate that work began on the dissent in the summer of 1993 , and in a memo preserved in Blackmun 's papers , the clerk writing the dissent wrote Blackmun that : Blackmun and his clerks then sought an appropriate case to serve as a " vehicle for [ the ] dissent , " and settled on " Callins " . That the case found the dissent , rather than the more traditional relationship of the dissent relating to the case , is underscored by the opinion 's almost total omission of reference to the case it ostensibly addressed : Callins is relegated to a supernumerary in his own appeal , being mentioned but five times in a 42-paragraph opinion Â   â € “ three times within the first two paragraphs , and twice in footnote 2 . In his emotional dissent in 1989 's " DeShaney v. Winnebago County " , rejecting the constitutional liability of the state of Wisconsin for four-year-old Joshua DeShaney , who was beaten until brain-damaged by his abusive father , Blackmun famously opined , " Poor Joshua ! " In his dissent in 1993 's " Herrera v. Collins " , where the Court refused to find a constitutional right for convicted prisoners to introduce new evidence of " actual innocence " for purposes of obtaining federal relief , Blackmun argued in a section joined by no other justice that " The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder . " In " Stanton v. Stanton " ( 1975 ) , a case striking down a state 's discriminatory definitions of adulthood ( males reaching it at 21 , women at 18 ) , Blackmun wrote : Blackmun has been noted for the fact that compared to other Justices on the Supreme Court , he had let his law clerks utilize great latitude as far as writing opinions for him , such as his opinion in " Planned Parenthood v. Casey " , which was written by Stephanie Dangel , now a lawyer in Pennsylvania . Blackmun 's " Casey " opinion draft included sharp criticism of Chief Justice Rehnquist , which included , according to Dangel , a sarcastic reference to Rehnquist as " The Chief " rather than Chief Justice because " I have my doubts as to whether he deserves to be called 'justice ' on this one . " Dangel , however , changed it to " Chief Justice " at the urging of Justice Anthony Kennedy . It has also been revealed by Blackmun in a 1995 oral history with Harold Koh that his dissent in " Bowers v. Hardwick " was written by a clerk , Pam Karlan . Blackmun said of the dissent ; " [ K ] arlan did a lot of very effective writing , and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out . She felt very strongly about it , and I think is correct in her approach to it . I think the dissent is correct . " When Blackmun 's papers were released at the Library of Congress , his sometimes negative notations regarding fellow Justice Clarence Thomas came to light . However , Thomas spoke positively of Blackmun when he appeared in 2001 at the dedication of the Harry A. Blackmun Rotunda at the St. Louis federal courthouse , mentioning that Blackmun drove a blue Volkswagen Beetle and would tell fast food patrons that he was " Harry . I work for the government . " Blackmun and Justice Potter Stewart shared an obsessive following of baseball . In one oral argument on October 10 , 1973 , Stewart passed Blackmun a note that read , " V.P . AGNEW JUST RESIGNED ! ! METS 2 REDS 0 . " Blackmun announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in April 1994 , four months before he officially left the bench . By then , he had become the court 's most liberal justice . In his place , President Bill Clinton nominated Stephen Breyer who was confirmed by the Senate 87 â € “ 9 . In 1995 , Blackmun received the U.S . Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official , an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards . In 1997 , Blackmun portrayed Justice Joseph Story in the Steven Spielberg film " Amistad " , making him the only Supreme Court justice to have played a judge in a motion picture . On February 22 , 1999 , Blackmun fell in his home and broke his hip . The next day , he underwent hip replacement surgery at Arlington Hospital in Arlington , Virginia , but he never fully recovered . Ten days later , on March 4 , at the age of 90 , he died at 1 Â   am from complications following the procedure . He was buried five days later at Arlington National Cemetery . His wife died seven years later on July 13 , 2006 , at the age of 95 , and was buried next to him . In 2004 the Library of Congress released his voluminous files . Blackmun had kept all the documents from every case , notes the Justices passed between themselves , 10 percent of the mail he received , and numerous other documents . After Blackmun announced his retirement from the Court , he recorded a 38-hour oral history with one of his former law clerks , former Yale Law School dean Harold Koh , which was also released . In it , he discusses his thoughts on everything from his important Court cases to the Supreme Court piano , though some Supreme Court experts such as David Garrow have cast doubt on the accuracy of some of Blackmun 's recollections , especially his thoughts on the Court 's deliberations on " Roe v. Wade " . Based on these papers , Linda Greenhouse of " The New York Times " wrote " Becoming Justice Blackmun " . Jan Crawford 's " Supreme Conflict " also draws heavily from the papers .
