Darkhan (city) ## SubjFoundObjFoundONESEN, Museum of Folk Art

Darkhan ( , " blacksmith " ) is the third-largest city in Mongolia and the capital of Darkhan-Uul Aimag ( Darkhan-Uul Province ) . It had a population of 74,738 in 2010 . On October 17 , 1961 , the city of Darkhan was built with extensive economic assistance from the Soviet Union . As its name implies , the city was originally conceived to be a manufacturing site for Mongolia 's northern territory . The city remains a mostly industrial region and is the home of some 82 % of Darkhan-Uul Province 's population . As with most urban Mongols , some 86 % of the city 's population live in residential apartments , with the remaining population living in yurts ( gers ) on the outskirts of the city . The city is relatively close to Russia and retains a fairly small percentage of native Russians . Darkhan has a borderline humid continental climate ( " Dwb " ) , close to the more typical subarctic climate ( " Dwc " ) of northern Mongolia , which is found in higher areas near the city , and only marginally wet enough to avoid qualifying as a semi-arid climate ( " BSk " ) . These three climate types tend to overlap a good deal over the border regions of Mongolia , Russia and Kazakhstan . This area has extremely cold and dry winters ; however the summers are warmer and more humid . < div/ > The Kharagiin monastery is housed in a pretty log cabin in the old town ; it has recently become active again as a Buddhist monastery . In addition , the city hosts the Museum of Darkhan-Uul . This museum , also called the Traditional Museum of Folk Art , contains a collection of archaeological findings , traditional clothing , religious artifacts , and taxidermy . The city has a monument to the horse-head fiddle ( morinkhuur ) , the national instrument of Mongolia . Darkhan is the second largest educational center in Mongolia , making the educational level of the city 's population very high .
