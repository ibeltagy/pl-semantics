Niihau ## SubjFoundObjFound

Niihau or Niihau ( ; Hawaiian : ) is the westernmost and seventh largest of the inhabited Hawaiian Islands in the U.S. state of Hawaii , lying southwest of Kauai across the Kaulakahi Channel and having an area of . Several intermittent playa lakes provide wetland habitats for the Hawaiian coot , the black-winged stilt , and the Hawaiian duck . The island is designated as critical habitat for " Brighamia insignis " , an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid . The United States Census Bureau defines Niihau and the neighboring island and State Seabird Sanctuary of Lehua as Census Tract 410 of Kauai County , Hawaii . Its 2000 census population was 160 ; As of June 2009 , the population was 130 . Elizabeth Sinclair purchased Niihau in 1864 from the Kingdom of Hawaii and private ownership passed on to her descendants , the Robinson family . During World War II , the island was the site of the Niihau Incident : A Japanese navy fighter pilot crashed on the island and terrorized its residents for a week after the attack on Pearl Harbor . The people of Niihau are known for their gemlike " lei p ≈ ´ p ≈ ´ " ( shell lei ) craftsmanship , and speak Hawaiian as a primary language . The island is generally off-limits to all but relatives of the island 's owners , U.S. Navy personnel , government officials and invited guests , giving it the nickname " The Forbidden Isle . " Beginning in 1987 , a limited number of supervised activity tours and hunting safaris have opened to tourists . The island is currently managed by Bruce and Keith Robinson . Niihau is located about west of Kauai , and the tiny , uninhabited island of Lehua lies north of Niihau . Niihau 's dimensions are 6.2 miles by 18.6 miles ( 10 ¬ † km x 30 ¬ † km ) . The maximum elevation ( Paniau ) is . The island is about 4.9 million years old , making it geologically younger than the 5-million-year-old neighboring island of Kauai to the northeast . Niihau consists of one extinct volcano that had a large landslide to the east . The island is relatively arid because it lies in the rain shadow of Kauai , and lacks the elevation needed to catch significant amounts of trade wind rainfall . Niihau therefore , depends for its rain on winter Kona storms , when more northerly weather systems intrude into the region . As such , the island is subject to long periods of drought . Historical droughts on Niihau have been recorded several times , one in 1792 by Captain James Cook 's former junior officer , George Vancouver , who had been told that the people of Niihau had abandoned the island because of a severe drought and had moved to Kauai to escape famine . As an arid island , Niihau was barren of trees for centuries ‚ Ä î Captain James Cook reported it treeless in 1778 . Aubrey Robinson , grandfather of current owners Bruce and Keith Robinson , planted 10,000 trees per year during much of his ownership of the island ; Robinson 's afforestation efforts increased rainfall in the dry climate . Island co-owner Keith Robinson , a noted conservationist , preserved and documented many of Niihau 's natural plant resources . The island is designated as a critical habitat for the " ≈ ç lulu " , an endemic and endangered species of Hawaiian lobelioid . " Aylmer robinsonii " , a Pritchardia palm tree named for Keith Robinson 's uncle Aylmer Robinson , is an endangered species native to Niihau . Several bird species thrive on Niihau . Intermittent playa lakes on the island provide wetland habitats for the " alae keokeo " ( Hawaiian coot ) , the " ƒ Å eo " ( black-winged stilt ) , and the " koloa maoli " ( Hawaiian duck ) . The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal ( " Monachus schauinslandi " ) is found in high numbers on Niihau 's shores . Robinson states that Niihau 's secluded shoreline offers them a safe haven from habitat encroachments . According to Robinson , conditions there are better than the government refuges of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands . When the Robinsons originally purchased Niihau , no monk seals were present , because they lived in the northwestern part of the Hawaiian island chain , Necker and Midway islands . They have been relocated to the main Hawaiian island chain by NOAA fisheries over the past thirty years , and some have found homes on Niihau . Big game herds , imported from stock on Molokai Ranch in recent years , roam Niihau 's forests and flatlands . Eland and aoudad are abundant , along with oryxes , wild boars and feral sheep . These big game herds provide income from hunting safari tourism . Prior to the unification of the Kingdom of Hawaii under Kamehameha I , Niihau was ruled by the " alii " . Kahelelani was the first of the Niihau alii . His name is now used to refer to the " Niihau kahelelani " , the puka shell of the wart turbans ( " Leptothyra verruca " ) , used to make exquisite Niihau shell jewelry . K ƒ Å   ª eok ≈ ´ lani was a ruler of northern Niihau who unified the island after defeating his rival , a chief named Kawaihoa . A stone wall ( P ƒ Å p ≈ ç haku ) across a quarter of the island 's southern end marked the boundaries of the two chiefs : K ƒ Å eo 's land was identified by black stones and Kawaihoa 's by white stones . Eventually , a great battle took place , known as Pali Kamakaui . K ƒ Å eo 's two brothers from the island of Maui , Kaiana and his half-brother Kahekili II , the King of Maui , fought for K ƒ Å eo and Niihau was united under his rule . Kawaihoa was banished to the south end of the island and K ƒ Å eo moved to the middle of the island to govern . K ƒ Å eo married the Queen Kamakahelei and a future king of Niihau and Kauai named Kaumualii was born in 1790 . Kauai and Niihau are said to have carried the " highest blood lines " in the Hawaiian Islands . Kamehameha managed to unify all of the islands by 1795 , except for Kauai and Niihau : Two attempts to conquer those islands had failed , and Kamehameha lost many men : bodies covered the beaches on Kauai 's eastern shores . Finally , in 1810 , Kamehameha amassed a great fleet , and Kaumualii , the last independent " alii " , surrendered rather than risk further bloodshed . Independence again became feasible after Kamehameha 's death in 1819 , but was put down when Kamehameha 's widow Kaahumanu kidnapped Kaumualii and forced him to marry her . Thereafter Niihau remained part of the unified Kingdom of Hawaii . Elizabeth McHutchison Sinclair ( 1800 ‚ Ä ì 1892 ) purchased Niihau and parts of Kauai from Kamehameha V in 1864 for $ 10,000 in gold . Sinclair chose Niihau over other options , including Waik ƒ ´ k ƒ ´ and Pearl Harbor . By around 1875 , Niihau 's population consisted of about 350 Native Hawaiians , with 20,000 sheep . This era marked the end of the art of Hawaiian mat ‚ Ä ì weaving made famous by the people of Niihau . " Makaloa " ( " Cyperus laevigatus " ) , a native sedge , used to grow on the edges of Niihau 's three intermittent lakes . The stems were harvested and used to weave " moena makaloa " ( mats ) , considered the " finest sleeping mats in Polynesia " . The mats were valued by " alii " and foreign visitors alike , but by the end of the 19th century , Hawaiians had stopped weaving " makaloa " due to changes in population , culture , economics , and the environment . In 1915 , Sinclair 's grandson Aubrey Robinson closed the island to most visitors . Even relatives of the inhabitants could visit only by special permission . Upon Aubrey 's death in 1939 the island passed to his son Aylmer , and in 1968 to Aylmer 's youngest brother Lester . Upon Lester 's wife Helen 's death , the island passed to his sons Bruce and Keith Robinson , the current co-owners . ( See Owners ' family tree ) Niihau played a small role during the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 , 1941 . In what has come to be called the Niihau Incident ( or the Battle of Niihau ) , an off-course Japanese pilot crash-landed on the island and was captured by locals . The pilot escaped with the assistance of local Japanese residents , but was later recaptured and killed . It was the subject of a popular song , " You Ca n't Conquer Niihau , Nohow " . Despite its self-imposed isolation , Niihau has a long-standing relationship with the U.S. military dating from 1924 . There is a small Navy installation on the island . No military personnel are permanently stationed there , but the U.S. military has used the island for training special operations units , which included hiring Hawaiians that live on Ni'ihau as " enemy " trackers . The island of Niihau was considered as a possible location for the United Nations headquarters in 1944 by Franklin D. Roosevelt . Roosevelt had visited Hawaii in 1934 . Under Cordell Hull , Roosevelt 's Secretary of State , the State Department seriously studied the proposal . In 2004 President George W. Bush received all but one of the 40 votes cast on the island . The remaining vote was cast for Green Party nominee David Cobb . 51 registered voters did not cast ballots . In 2006 Dan Akaka received 33 votes in the 2006 Senate election to Cynthia Thielen 's 3 . In 2008 , Niihau 's precinct was one of only 3 of Hawaii 's 538 precincts to vote for John McCain over Barack Obama . McCain received 35 votes , Obama received 4 , and Cynthia McKinney received 1 . Niihau has approximately 130 permanent inhabitants , nearly all of whom are Native Hawaiians who live in the island 's main settlement of Puuwai . Some support themselves largely by subsistence fishing and farming , while others depend on welfare . All residents live rent-free , and meat is free . Niihau has no telephone services and no paved roads . Horses are the main form of transportation ; bicycles are also used . There are no power lines ; solar power provides all electricity . There is no plumbing or running water on the island . Water comes from rainwater catchment . The Robinson family established most of these conditions . There is no hotel or general store ; barges deliver groceries from Kauai , often purchased by relatives , with free shipping . Residents generally speak the Niihau dialect of Hawaiian as their first language , in part encouraged by terms in the original purchase contract which obligated the new owners to help preserve Hawaiian culture and tradition . The Niihau dialect differs from modern Hawaiian in that , for example , and are the most common realizations of the phonemes and . Niihau is the only island where Hawaiian is spoken as a primary language . Linguistic evidence and oral tradition maintain that the Niihau dialect is closer to the Hawaiian register spoken during the time of discovery . English is the second language . Some residents have radio and television sets , although limited reception effectively limits the latter to watching VHS tapes and DVDs . Niihau is subject to regular droughts that occasionally force the population to evacuate to Kauai temporarily , until rainfall replenishes their water supply . Residents commonly also commute to Kauai for work , medical care , or school , and many of them call both islands home . To avoid a long boat ride , the island 's owners maintain an Agusta A109 helicopter for emergencies and for transporting Navy contractors and residents to and from Kauai . Helicopter tours and safaris help offset the costs of this service . A form of ipu art is known to have developed solely on the island of Niihau . In this method , after a design is carved in the skin of a fresh gourd , it is filled with dye which , after several weeks , changes the color of the uncarved portions of the surface where the skin is intact . Hawaiian music plays a central role on the island , with a cappella singers making use of only two or three tones and changing rhythms . Ukulele and guitar playing is nearly ubiquitous among the islanders , and there are three separate styles of slack-key music , with an older style originating from Kohala . The Hawaii Department of Education operates the Niihau School , a K-12 school . Academic subjects and computer literacy are combined with teaching students to " thrive from the land . " The school is powered entirely by solar power . The number of students varies from 25 to 50 since families often travel between Niihau and Kauai . Schoolchildren may stay with relatives in west Kauai , where they attend one of two Niihau-focused public charter schools . At the Ke Kula Niihau o Kekaha school , students speak primarily the Niihau dialect through the early elementary grades , and then Hawaiian and English through grade 12 . The school has a digital recording and video system , which helps to preserve and teach traditional Niihau and Hawaiian culture . At the other west Kauai school , Kula Aupuni Niihau a Kahelelani Aloha ( KANAKA ) , English is used in all grades , while still supporting the Niihau dialect . Both schools foster the culture , values , and spirituality of Niihau . Approximately 80 % of Niihau 's income comes from a small Navy installation atop 1,300-foot-high cliffs . Remote-controlled tracking devices are used for testing and training with Kaua'i 's Pacific Missile Range Facility . Modern missile defense tests are conducted at the site for the U.S. and its allies . The installation brings in millions of dollars a year , and provides the island with a stable economic base without the complexity of tourism or industrial development . The sale of shells and shell jewelry is an additional source of income . Its beaches are known for their " p ≈ ´ p ≈ ´ " , tiny shells that wash onto shore during winter months . Species used for shell leis includes " momi " ( " Euplica varians " ) , " laiki " or rice shells ( " Mitrella margarita " ) and " kahelelani " ( " Leptothyra verruca " ) . The shells and jewelry are so popular that Governor Linda Lingle signed a bill in 2004 to protect " lei p ≈ ´ p ≈ ´ o Niihau " ( Niihau shell leis ) from counterfeiting . A single , intricate Niihau shell lei can sell for thousands of dollars . Many residents of Niihau were once employees of Niihau Ranch , farming cattle and sheep until the Robinsons shut down the operation in 1999 . It had not been profitable for most of the 20th century . Honey cultivation was also no longer viable by 1999 . Kiawe charcoal was once a large-scale export , but aggressive Mexican price competition ended that as well . Mullet farming has been popular on Niihau , with ponds and lakes stocked with baby mullet , which reach apiece before being harvested and sold on Kauai and Oahu . Bruce Robinson , Niihau 's co-owner , is seeking and considering new forms of non-invasive income generation . Depending on feasibility , impact , and ecological footprint on the ecosystem and culture , possibilities include : JP-4 or JP8 generation by the lignocellulose process ; military , including a possible runway ; and windmill energy production . Robinson has declined offers to purchase sand from Niihau 's beaches , because of adverse environmental effects . Niihau 's owners have offered half-day helicopter and beach tours of the island since 1987 , although contact with residents is avoided and no accommodations exist . Since 1992 , hunting safaris provide income via tourists who pay to visit the island to hunt eland , aoudad , and oryx , as well as wild sheep and boars . Any meat the hunters do not take with them is given to the village .
